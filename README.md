Hello Guys,
This app is built on pytube and customTkinter.
For the main purpose of downloading the videos, the program first extracts the video and audio files from the YT video online using pytube and then merges both of them using ffmpeg.
This Project is for my own Education Purpose only but I would like yall to test it out and review it for me.
All kinds of reviews are accepted.
